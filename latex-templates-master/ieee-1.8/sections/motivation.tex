\section{Motivating Example}
\label{motivation}

Give a 2-4 paragraph overview of a motivating
example. Make sure and explain how your motivating
example fits into the core theme and why your
motivating example is an important one (e.g. why
should anyone care about your example). It is
good to have a nice diagram in this section that
you refer to when describing your motivating
example. Also, make sure and allude to the
overall problem that you spelled out in the
introduction.
