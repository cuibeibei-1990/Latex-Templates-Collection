\section{XYZ Solution}
\label{solution}

Start your solution section with an overview of all
of the components of your solution. It is a good idea
to have a high-level diagram showing how all of the
components of your solution fit together.

\subsection{Solution Component 1}
\label{solutionpart1}

It is ideal if you can break your solution down
into components that each address a specific
challenge that you outlined. If this breakdown
doesn't make sense, make sure and explain how
you address each of the challenges by referring
back to them with "... to address Challenge 1, from
Section~\ref{challenge1}."
